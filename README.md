# Mathpy
Naive python implementation of various algorithms provenient from mathematical theorem, such as Euclid's division algorithm, Newton's method to find roots of functions and trapezion method to integrate functions.

You can use it to solve exercises or make calculations more rapidly, to better comprehension of some mathematical result, or just to illustrate some mathematical property.

Have fun!
